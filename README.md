CSS application

This is an application that is part of a Udemy.com course React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.



Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!


This application lets the user create a course goal and add it to the application.
The background area where the user inputs the new goal will be pink until they submit the new goal to be added.
The user can add as many gaols as they wish.
Once the goal is completed, the user will click on that particular goal which appears in a burgundy colored box.
Once clicked the goal will disappear.
Once all goals are completed, a message will pop up reading "No goals found. Maybe add one?"

This application may be simple but teaches how to create buttons, execute instructions, utilize state hooks, use const and let variables, addGo Handler and deleteItemHandler, get ElementById("root"), etc.
